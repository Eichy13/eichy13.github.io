                Skiing is a popular winter sport and recreational activity that involves sliding down snow-covered slopes using skis attached to the feet. It is primarily practiced in mountainous regions with sufficient snowfall during the winter months. 
                Skis are long, narrow, and curved at both ends to help with maneuverability and stability. The main objective of skiing is to navigate down the slopes while maintaining balance and control over the skis. Skiers typically use ski poles to assist with propulsion and balance. 
                The sport can be enjoyed at various skill levels, from beginners on gentle slopes to expert skiers tackling challenging terrains and slopes.

                    For those who are learning to ski for the first time, there are basic techniques that need to be learnt to avoid hurting one self. 
                    One of these techniquesis is Wedge (Triangle) Skiing:
                    This is a beginner-level skiing technique used to control speed and make basic turns.

                    <p>
                        Heres how to do it:

                </div>
                <div class = "SkiTechniqueButtons">
                    <p>
                        Step 1:
                        Begin with your skis in a "V" shape, with the tips closer together and the tails wider apart, forming a wedge. 
                        Bend your knees slightly and keep your weight centered.
                        This will help keep speed while sking down the mountain constant.

                <div class = "SkiTechniqueButtons">
                    <p>
                        Step 2:
                        To slow down, push the tails of the skis outward, increasing the wedge angle. 
                        The wider the wedge, the greater the friction, resulting in decreased speed.
                        To go faster, push the tails of the skis inward, decreasing the wedge angle.
                        The narrower the wedge, the lesser the friction, resulting in greater speed.
                    </p>

                <div class = "SkiTechniqueButtons">
                    <p>
                        Step 3:
                        To turn left, apply more pressure to the inside edge of your right ski, which will steer you to the left. 
                        To turn right, apply more pressure to the inside edge of your left ski, steering you to the right.

                <div class = "SkiTechniqueButtons">
                    <p>
                        Step 4:
                        As you complete the turn, gradually bring your skis back to a parallel position and prepare for the next turn.
                        Then you repeat again.

                    For those newcomers to skiing or those who have skied for a long time. A good recomandation for a hotel would be Setsu Niseko. 
                    Personally to me, Setsu Niseko is a very good choice for a ski resort and a good place for skiing. THis is for serveral reasons. 
                    One is the resort is located in Niseko renowned for its abundant and high-quality snowfall and the area receives consistent snowfall throughout the winter season, creating ideal conditions for skiing and snowboarding.
                    Another is that the hotel facilities are very mordern due to opening quite recently, these includes free buses that bring you to the mountain, a rental shop which is part of the hotel, and more.

                    Whenever you go skiing, you would also look at the tracks the mountain offers. Theres many different tracks to look for but the main 4 are.
                    Green (Beginner), Yellow/Orange (Intermediate), Black (Advanced), Double black/ Double diamond (Expert).
                    Hirafu and Hanzono contains a good split of these and offeres tracks for all levels of skiiers which allows good options for everyone who goes.
                    Whether they are a new skiier or a advanced one.

                They are quite important as they help protect your eyes from the harsh conditions up in the mountain.
                The quaility of goggles however ranges from low to very high prices so is completly fine to just purchase a cheap one as they still get the job done. (Might be unconfortable)
                However, if you don't want to buy one you can always just forgo them for some sunglasses instead. (Not the best choice)

                Unless you are used to living in negative degrees temperature. You will have to invest in some clothing that helps you not die and get frostbite.
                You can't rent these usually so I would recommand to just buy them. Usually 3 sets will be good enough for a 5 day trip.
                Personally, I recommand getting uniqlo Ultra warm heattech clothing. I use them myself and it works really well (Haven't died to the cold yet).
